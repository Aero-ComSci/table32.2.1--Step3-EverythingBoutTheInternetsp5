            <h2>About the Internet</h2>
            <p>The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). Originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, ARPANET used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.
                On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” communication from one computer to another. (The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA and the second was at Stanford; each was the size of a small house.) The message—“LOGIN”—was short and simple, but it crashed the fledgling ARPA network anyway: The Stanford computer only received the note’s first two letters. The technology continued to grow in the 1970s after scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, a communications model that set standards for how data could be transmitted between multiple networks. ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there, researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. While it’s often confused with the internet itself, the web is just the most common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks. The web helped popularize the internet among the public and served as a crucial step in developing the vast trove of information that most of us now access daily.

                    <h3 class="text-title">The internet is a groundbreaking computing innovation that has essentially changed how people connect, share resources, and co-operate real time. With connected networks, easy global co-operations are possible, where people, institutions, and institutions can share resources immediately without considering where people are located. The feature has significantly promoted productivity in most fields, including business, health, business, and entertainment, by making people instant resource access possible together with resources of great quantity.</h3>

                    <h3 class="text-title">One of the most characteristic features of the internet as a computing innovation is that it is scalable. It is possible to use millions of people on it worldwide, constantly changing to accommodate increasing demand and technological innovation. It also helps in automation and productivity by making possible things like cloud computing, integration of AI, and automated management of resources. All of these features make possible better management of resources, decision making, and business innovation driving it.</h3>

                    <h3 class="text-title">
                        The internet is also interactive, making possible instant chats, video calls, and collaborative workplaces, making real-time co-operations easy like never before. Such levels of connective integration have changed how people and institutions co-operate, eliminating barriers and opening up new possibilities of engagement. The internet is also distributed, where there is no point of control. Such an arrangement creates room for free flows of resources and constant innovation, where there is no need to wait on a governing body to make possible new things through technological innovation, platforms, or software programs.

            <h2>How does the internet actually work?</h2>
            <p>The internet is a vast network of millions of computers connected globally, allowing for communication and the sharing of information. Understanding how the internet works begins with a unique identifier, known as the IP address. An IP address is unique to each computer connected to the internet, and so no two computers have the same IP address.

                We have already established that computers are linked together via the Internet. But the sharing of information from one IP address to another requires a catalyst, or converter. That catalyst must be able to convert information expressed in the form of alphabetic text to electric signals expressed in binary. These signals are transmitted through the Internet from one computer to another. That catalyst is known as the protocol stack.

                A protocol stack facilitates communication between computers connected to the Internet. It is a collection of multiple network protocols, or layers. Each layer is designed for a specific purpose, existing on both the sending and receiving hosts.
